This update introduced some new features and fixes to the game, such as:
 
- Legendary difficulty setting for hardcore players who want a greater challenge.
- Legendary skills that allow you to reset your skill level to 15 and remove the skill limit of 100, effectively making you level up indefinitely.
- Various bug fixes and performance improvements, such as memory optimizations, stability enhancements, and minor art and lighting corrections.

To get this update, you need to have the Steam version of the game, which will automatically download and install it for you. If you have a non-Steam version of the game, you will need to find a cracked or unofficial patch online, which is not recommended or supported by Bethesda.
 
If you want to check your game version, you can either hit ESC in-game and look at the bottom left corner of the screen, or right-click on the Skyrim.exe file in your Steam folder and select Properties > Details.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Update 1.9.32.0.8 is the final official patch for the original game, as Bethesda has moved on to other projects such as Fallout 4 and Skyrim Special Edition. However, the modding community is still active and creating new content and fixes for the game, so you can always find something new and exciting to enhance your Skyrim experience.

One of the main reasons why Skyrim is still popular and modded in 2023 is the variety and quality of the mods available. Whether you want to add new quests, companions, locations, weapons, armor, magic, or gameplay features, there is a mod for you. Here are some examples of the best Skyrim mods in 2023 that you can try:
 
## Alternate Start - Live Another Life
 
If you are tired of the same old intro sequence where you are a prisoner on your way to Helgen, this mod lets you choose from a number of different scenarios to start your adventure. You can be a member of a guild, a noble, a vampire, a hunter, a bandit, and more. Each option has its own unique location and backstory, and some of them even have custom quests and dialogue. This mod adds a lot of replay value and role-playing possibilities to Skyrim.
 
## SkyUI
 
This mod is a must-have for anyone who plays Skyrim on PC. It overhauls the user interface to make it more intuitive, user-friendly, and compatible with mouse and keyboard. It also adds features like sortable inventory, quick menus, search functions, and more. SkyUI is compatible with most other mods and is highly customizable.
 
## Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim
 
This mod revamps the perk system in Skyrim, adding hundreds of new perks that make each skill tree more diverse and interesting. You can specialize in different playstyles, such as stealth, magic, combat, crafting, or exploration. The perks are balanced and lore-friendly, and some of them even have unique effects and animations. Ordinator makes leveling up more rewarding and fun.
