# Rick Astley - The Ultimate Collection: A Review of the 2008 Album
 
Rick Astley is one of the most distinctive and successful singers from the late 1980s, who rose to fame with the help of the production team Stock, Aitken & Waterman. His deep and soulful voice, combined with catchy dance-pop tunes, earned him seven Top Ten hits in the UK and two number ones in the US. In 2008, a compilation album titled The Ultimate Collection: Rick Astley was released, featuring all of his hit singles as well as some lesser-known tracks from his later career.

The album follows a chronological order, starting with his debut and biggest hit "Never Gonna Give You Up", which became a worldwide phenomenon and a meme in the 2000s. The song showcases Astley's vocal range and charisma, as well as the signature SAW sound of synthesizers, drum machines and backing vocals. The album also includes his other US number one "Together Forever", a similar upbeat track that expresses his romantic devotion. Other SAW-produced songs on the album are "Whenever You Need Somebody", "It Would Take a Strong Strong Man", "She Wants to Dance with Me", "Take Me to Your Heart" and "Hold Me in Your Arms". These songs are all catchy and energetic, but also show some variation in style and mood.
 
The album also features Astley's two main ballads, "When I Fall in Love" and "Cry for Help". The former is a cover of the classic song by Nat King Cole, which Astley sings with sincerity and emotion. The latter is an original song co-written by Astley, which showcases his powerful voice over a gospel-inspired arrangement. Both songs demonstrate Astley's versatility and talent as a singer.
 
The album also includes some of Astley's lesser-known singles from the 1990s, such as "Hopelessly", "The Ones You Love", "Never Knew Love" and "Sleeping". These songs are more mature and sophisticated than his earlier hits, reflecting his growth as an artist and a person. They also feature more live instruments and less production, giving them a more organic and authentic feel.
 
The album closes with three bonus tracks: "Body and Soul", a self-composed song that was previously unreleased; "Full of You", another original song that was new for this compilation; and "Vincent", a cover of the Don McLean song about the painter Vincent van Gogh. These songs show Astley's artistic vision and creativity, as well as his appreciation for different genres and influences.
 
The Ultimate Collection: Rick Astley is a comprehensive and enjoyable album that showcases Astley's career and achievements as a singer. It contains all of his memorable hits, as well as some hidden gems that deserve more attention. It is a must-have for any fan of Astley or of 1980s pop music in general.

One of the reasons why Rick Astley's music has endured and gained new fans over the years is his involvement in the phenomenon of "rickrolling". This is a prank that involves tricking someone into clicking a link that leads to the video of "Never Gonna Give You Up", usually under the pretense of something else. The prank became popular in the late 2000s, especially on the internet, and has been used by celebrities, politicians and even Astley himself. The prank has given Astley a new level of fame and recognition, as well as a sense of humor and goodwill.
 
Another reason why Rick Astley's music is still relevant and appreciated today is his comeback in the 2010s. After a hiatus from the music industry, Astley returned with a new album in 2016 called 50, which he wrote and produced himself. The album was a critical and commercial success, reaching number one in the UK and selling over 300,000 copies. The album featured songs that reflected Astley's life experiences and personal views, such as "Keep Singing", "Angels on My Side" and "Dance". The album also showed Astley's musical diversity, incorporating elements of soul, gospel, rock and disco. Astley followed up with another album in 2018 called Beautiful Life, which also received positive reviews and charted well. Astley proved that he still had the passion and talent to make music that resonated with his fans and new listeners alike.
 
Rick Astley is one of the most successful and enduring singers of his generation. His music has spanned decades, genres and cultures, and has touched millions of people around the world. His voice is unmistakable and unforgettable, and his songs are timeless and uplifting. His career is a testament to his hard work, dedication and talent, as well as his humility, generosity and kindness. He is a true legend of pop music, and deserves to be celebrated and respected.
