Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey. He has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and more than 120 million worldwide and he has earned numerous awards for his work, including 21 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award. He is widely regarded by many as one of the most influential songwriters of the 20th century, and in 2004, Rolling Stone ranked him as the 23rd Greatest Artist of all time[^1^].
 
His collection of albums from 1973 to 2012 covers a wide range of styles and themes, from the energetic rock anthems of Born to Run and Born in the U.S.A. to the more somber folk-oriented works of Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. He also experimented with different genres and sounds, such as the pop-rock of Tunnel of Love, the soul-influenced Human Touch and Lucky Town, and the acoustic Devil's & Dust. His later albums reflect his social and political views, such as The Rising, which was inspired by the September 11 attacks, Magic, which was critical of the Bush administration, and Wrecking Ball, which addressed the economic crisis and inequality.

Bruce Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949 in Long Branch, New Jersey, USA. His father, Douglas Springsteen, worked as a bus driver, and was of Irish and Dutch ancestry. His mother, Adele (Zerilli) Springsteen, worked as a legal secretary, and was of Italian descent. He grew up in Freehold, a mill town where his father struggled to make ends meet. He became interested in music after seeing Elvis Presley perform on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and got a guitar, but he didn't start playing seriously until 1963[^3^] [^4^].
 
He joined several bands in his teenage years, such as the Castiles, Earth, and Steel Mill, and played in clubs and bars around New Jersey. He also developed his skills as a songwriter, influenced by folk, rock, soul, and rhythm and blues artists. In 1972, he auditioned for talent scout John Hammond, Sr., who signed him to Columbia Records. He then formed the E Street Band, which consisted of saxophonist Clarence Clemons, keyboardist Danny Federici, bassist Garry Tallent, drummer Vini Lopez, and later guitarist Steven Van Zandt[^2^].
 
His first two albums with Columbia, Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle, released in 1973, did not sell well but received critical acclaim for their lyrical sophistication and musical diversity. He then changed his style and achieved his breakthrough with Born to Run (1975), which featured a more polished production and a grandiose sound that evoked the Phil Spector's \"wall of sound\" technique. The album's title track became a hit single and an anthem for Springsteen's fans[^2^].
